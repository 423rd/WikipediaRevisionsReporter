## Markdown Tips

If you are unfamiliar with MarkDown, check out 
[the official documentation](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

Note that IntelliJ IDEA has a Markdown preview that you can access in 
the upper-right of the editor. Also, since Markdown documents&mdash;like
source code&mdash;should be human-readable, make sure you keep your lines
short, as you can see I have done in my Markdown files.

Please remove this subsection before submitting your report.
